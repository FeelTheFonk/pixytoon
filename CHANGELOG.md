# Changelog

All notable changes to SDDj are documented here.

## [0.8.9] — 2026-03

### Added
- Temporal coherence engine: LAB color matching, auto noise coupling, optical flow blending
- Distilled step scale cap for Hyper-SD models

### Changed
- Engine refactored from single `engine.py` to modular `engine/` package (core, animation, audio_reactive, helpers)

### Removed
- Live Paint mode (event-driven real-time painting) — removed entirely

---

## [0.8.7] — 2026-02

### Fixed
- Sub-floor blending: audio modulation below the denoising quality floor now smoothly attenuates instead of clamping

---

## [0.7.9] — 2025

### Added
- Palette CRUD: save/delete custom palettes from the UI (persist as JSON)

## [0.7.7] — 2025

### Added
- Contextual action button adapts to active tab (GENERATE, ANIMATE, AUDIO GEN)
- Universal randomize across all pipelines
- Randomness slider (0-20 scale)
- Dedicated per-pipeline Steps/CFG/Strength sliders (Animation + Audio)
- Audio-linked randomness: auto-generates prompt segments from musical structure

## [0.7.4] — 2025

### Added
- Audio-reactive motion/camera: smooth Deforum-like pan, zoom, rotation
- 7-layer anti-spaghetti protection for motion warp
- 4 dedicated motion presets + 14 existing presets enriched with motion
- Frame limit control (0 = all, or exact count)

## [0.7.3] — 2025

### Added
- AnimateDiff + Audio: 16-frame temporal batches with overlap blending
- MP4 export with nearest-neighbor upscaling and audio mux
- Sub-bass, upper-mid, presence frequency bands
- Palette shift and frame cadence modulation targets

### Fixed
- Cancellation works during long-running generations (concurrent receive)

## [0.7.0] — 2025

### Added
- Audio reactivity: synth-style modulation matrix
- 10 audio feature sources, 5 modulation targets
- Attack/release EMA smoothing

- Stem separation (demucs, CPU)
- 20 built-in modulation presets

## [0.6.1] — 2025

### Added
- Sequence output mode (new layer vs new frame)
